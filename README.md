### Compiling
To compile the project, first, create a `build` directory and change to that directory:
```
mkdir -p build && cd build
```
From within the `build` directory, then run `cmake ..` and `make` as follows:
```
cmake ..
make
```
### Running
The executable will be placed in the `build` directory. From within `build`, you can run the project as follows:
```
./Main
```
